# Contributing to SwiftyStoreKit

All contributions to SwiftyStoreKit are welcome. ðŸ˜Ž

While the maintainer(s) try to regularly keep the project alive and healthy, issues and pull requests are not always reviewed in a timely manner. ðŸ•°

## Pull requests

The project uses [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as a branching model.

In short:

* All pull requests for **new features** and **bug fixes** should be made into the `develop` branch.
* Pull requests for **hot fixes** can be done into both `master` and `develop`.
* The maintainer(s) will merge `develop` into `master` and create a release tag as new features are added.
* All releases [can be found here](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/releases).


## Issues

If SwiftyStoreKit doesn't work as you expect, please review [any open issues](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues) before opening a new one.
